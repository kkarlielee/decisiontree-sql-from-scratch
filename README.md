# decisiontree-sql-from-scratch
This project showcases my implementation of the Decision Tree Induction Algorithm using SQL. I have crafted this implementation with a reference to the ID3 algorithm, a well-established decision tree construction approach. Within this project, a detailed description of how SQL can be employed to create decision trees and the corresponding code explanation can be found.
